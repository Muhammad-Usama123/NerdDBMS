What is a database?

    // We all use data and databases in our daily online lives, for example, uploading photos to social media feeds, downloading files at work and playing games online are all examples of database usage...

// What exactly is data and how does it interacts with the database?

// What does a database actually look like?

    // A database looks like data organized systematically and this organization typically looks like a spreadsheet or a table...

        // also see the caption text in these below pics:

            // pic saved with name "SystematicData" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "SystematicData2" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "SystematicData3" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "SystematicData4" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "SystematicData5" in this pc...

                // Systematic Data:

                    // 1) Identifiable features or attributes...
                    // 2) Stored in entities...

                    all data contains elements or attributes and features by which they can be identified. For example, a person can be identified by attributes like their age, height and hair colour and this data is separated and stored in what's known as entities, that represent those elements...

                // as you just learned, an entity is like a table, it contains rows and columns that store data relating to a specific element, in other words, these are relational elements, they're related to one another. These entities could be physical representations like an employee, a customer or a product, or they can be conceptual like an invoice, an order or quotation: 

                    //                                                            Entity

                                Column 1                                          Column 2                              column 3
                                Data                                              Data                                  Data
                                Data                                              Data                                  Data
                                Data                                              Data                                  Data

                // Entities then store data in a table like format, against the attributes or features, related to the element.These attributes could include first name, last name, date of birth and emails like below example of customer entity:

            // pic saved with name "customerentity" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "customerentity2" in this pc...

                                                                        // Customer Entity

                In the relational database world these entities are known as relations or tables. The attributes become the columns of the table and each table row represents an instance of that entity. As an example, let's take the entities from the online store example that we just explored. These two examples could be combined into a list of orders, the store received from it's customers, within a database this data could be renderred as an order table or entity...:

            // pic saved with name "entity14" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "entity15" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "entity16" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "entity17" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "entity18" in this pc...
            // pic saved with name "entity19" in this pc...

            // combining the 2 separate entities or combining some features of those separate entities like "customer entity" and "product entity" into a new entity called "orderentity" maybe:

                // pic saved with name "entity20" in this pc...
                // pic saved with name "orderentity" in this pc...
                // pic saved with name "orderentity2" in this pc...

                                                                        // Order Entity

                        Order Number                    Customer ID                       Product                     Cost

            // Ways To Organize Data In A Database:

                // There are many ways to organize data in a database. Relational databases aren't the only kind of databases that you'll encounter. As a database engineer you'll work with many different types of databases:

                    // pic saved with name "waysotoorganizingdatainadatabase" in this pc...
                    // pic saved with name "waysotoorganizingdatainadatabase2" in this pc...

                    // pic saved with name "waysotoorganizingdatainadatabase4" in this pc...

                    // Types of databases:

                        // Here's a few common examples of other types of databases:

                            // Object Oriented Databases: Data stored in the form of objects...

                                // An object oriented database is where data is stored in the form of objects instead of tables or relations. An example of this kind of database could be an online bookstore:

                                // pic saved with name "ObjectOrientedDatabases2" in this pc...

                    // Big data: in video from maybe 20:00...

                        // Relational databases mostly store structured data(limitation of relational Databases) (but in big data maybe unstructured data also comes) databases are now required to store more and more unstructured data, so the trend in recent years is to rely on no sql databases (flexible structure for storing and scaling data)  instead (makes scaling easy)...

                        // no sql databases are a type of database that store data in a variety of different formats, databases with a flexible structure(facilitating a change to the database structure itself, without the need for complex data models), makes scaling easy... no sql databases are used by social media platforms, The Internet Of Things(IOT), artificial intelligence and other applications that generate massive amounts of unstructured data...

                        // let's take a closer look at big data and cloud databases:

                            // Essentially these terms are used to describe a recent change in our approach to data and databases. let's start with a look at big data first:

                                // Big Data: // Complex data that grows exponentially with time...

                                    // Big data is complex data that can increase in volume with time. 
                                    
                                        // But where does this kind of complex data come from:

                                            // Social Media Platforms, Online shopping sites and other services generates massive amounts of data every second of the day as they capture the actions of billions of users around the world and with the Internet Of Things (or IOT), more and more devices are now connected to the internet generating even more and more data. This is how complex data or big data is. All this data is highly unstructured or semi-structured, traditional database systems could deal with structured data using tables, records and relationships, but big data is a whole new challenge...

                                    // Use Of Big Data:

                                        // 1) Types Of Data: Combination of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data...

                                            // Big data is a combination of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data collected from many different sources.

                                        // 2) Data Power: More powerful than traditional data when solving problems...

                                            // It adds more power to data because it can address complex business problems that traditionally structured data can't handle...
