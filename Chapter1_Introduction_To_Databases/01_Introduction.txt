// Course Introduction:

    // Almost everyone has used the database and more likely information about us is probably present in many databases all over the world, but who knows what a database is and how important database engineering is to Global industry, government and organizations..

        // Database:

            // A form of electronic storage in which data is held...

        // Explaining the impact of database technology;

            // To give an idea of databases in a real world context, let's briefly describe some typical use cases:

                // Banking:

                    // For example, your bank uses a database to store data for customers, bank accounts and transactions

                // Hospital:

                    // A hospital stores patient data, staff data, laboratory data and more.

                // Online Store: (Shopping)

                    // An online store retains your profile information, along with your shopping history and accounting transactions...

            Many of the above described services have access to a diverse range of data...

            // Other items in Databases other than above described data:

                // Your location data...
                // duration on the platform...
                // connections with other users... alongside many more facts... 

                // Big Data: 

                    // such online services and social media platforms generate enormous amounts of data due to their large user base and constant user activity and with the internet of things (or iot) many extra devices are now connected to the internet. These continual streams of data have led to a revolution in database technology to accommodate the volume, variety and complexity of what has become known as Big Data...

                    // Whatever the source of the data, a database will typically carry out the following actions, all of which a database engineer must be familiar with:

                        // Database Tasks:

                            // Store the data...
                            // Form connections or relationships between segmented areas of the data...
                            // Filter the data to show relevant records...
                            // Search data to return matching records...
                            // Perform CRUD operations... (have the functions to allow the data to be updated, changed and deleted as required)

                            // for now you are just receiving a brief introduction to databases and data, during the course you'll explore these concepts in more detail, alongside the many other tasks, that form the duties of a database engineer:
